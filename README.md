# Bugs Out

This game is developed using the excellent [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) and is my submission for the [Game Off 2021](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021) jam.

## Description

Each players choose a resource between an apple, a cheese, a cookie or a carrot and must try to guide the bug to their resource to win a token. First player with 5 tokens win the game !

Each turn, player rolls a dice to know which obstacle they can rotate to create a path to reach the resources.

All inspiration is coming from [Bugs in the Kitchen](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137909/bugs-kitchen) board game by Ravensburger.
